Intro
==========================
There are two components for IK. The first on is the "Fast IK Fabric". The secound one is the "Fast IK Look". These will affect your bones.

==========================
Fast IK Fabric
==========================
Add the component to the last chain element for your IK chain and set the values.

ChainLength (required): Chain length of bones
Target (required): The target of the IK
Pole (optional): Pole for bending the chain
Iterations (required): Iterations to find good IK angles. Everything > 1 should be fine. (runtime / quality tradeoff)
Delta (required): At which recision the algorithm should stop. (runtime / quality tradeoff)
SnapBackStrength (required): The force that is used to get back to the start position of the bones.

During runtime you can move the target and the pole. You could also move the first bone of the chain. The other bones are imovable.
