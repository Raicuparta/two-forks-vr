Note: this version of Two Forks VR only works with the December 2021 (or later) update of Firewatch.
If you have an older update, you need to use Two Forks VR 0.0.8 or earlier.

Find the Firewatch directory.
Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Firewatch".
Firewatch.exe is inside this directory.

Extract the mod zip to anywhere (can be on your desktop or whatever, doesn't need to be in the game's directory).

Then drag the Firewatch.exe file, and drop it on top of TwoForksVRInstaller.exe.

You should see a command line window with some stuff happening.

In the end it should say "Installed successfully, probably. Press any key to close this console.".

You can now start the game via Firewatch.exe.
